 spain.1.t:0 "Civil War!"
 spain.1.d:0 "A group of powerful generals in the Armed Forces have issued a pronunciamento, denouncing the current government of Spain! They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservative monarchists and the clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Spain's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Republican government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.1.a:0 "The Nationalists!"
 spain.1.b:0 "The Republicans!"
 spain.10.d:1 "After the peaceful election of General Francisco Franco as president of Spain, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumors that Franco would attempt to create a one-party dictatorship with himself as chief of state has been fueled by the sudden disappearances of several opposition leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Spain it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"

 spain.2.t:0 "Seek International Support?"
 spain.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but Carlists, Falangists and the Confederation of the Autonomous Right have managed to mobilize a large part of the army to overthrow the Republic, which has too long allowed our proud Christian nation to fall apart into anarchy. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 spain.2.a:0 "Let's request equipment and munitions."
 spain.2.b:0 "Spain must be won with Spanish blood!"
 spain.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."

 spain.3.b:0 "We will not become a puppet of degenerated workers' states!"
 spain.4.t:0 "Nationalist Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.4.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War has become a sort of microcosm for our view of the global situation: Communists and liberals seek to destroy old values, and we take up arms to revive them. It is not surprising that the Nationalists in Spain have reached out to us and others to equip them for the coming conflict."

 spain.4.b:0 "If they lack the strength to seize power, they do not deserve it."
 spain.5.t:0 "Republican Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.5.d:0 "The attempt to overthrow the Second Spanish Republic is a clear signal that the fascists will not allow the flowers of progress to grow even where they naturally take root. The Republicans and their allies, a mix of democrats, communists and anarchists, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help. Many nations who claim to defend democracy and liberty have withheld their support for fear of being dragged into the war. How do we respond?"
 spain.5.a:0 "Promise them to send arms and equipment."

 spain.8.d:0 "The war is won. Madrid is ours again and we have opportunity to make the age old city the center of Spain once again. It has seen much battle and will require rebuilding. What better way to do this than making it our capital?"
 spain.8.a:0 "Move capital to Madrid"
 spain.8.b:0 "Keep current location"
 spain.9.t:0 "Spanish Election of 1936"
 spain.9.d:0 "The Second Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Spain will have to endure to resolve this conflict."
 spain.9.a:0 "Maintain the Popular Front."

 finland.1.t:0 "The Russians Demand Karelia"
 finland.1.d:0 "Citing the need to create a security buffer for Leningrad, officials from the Soviet Union have asked for a revision of our borders. They want us to cede Karelia to them, and judging by the build-up of Soviet forces along our border, they will not take no for an answer. How should we respond?"

 finland.1.b:0 "Let them come if they dare!"
 finland.2.t:0 "Request Swedish Assistance in War"
 finland.2.d:0 "Finland and the Soviet Union are at war. After only a few decades of sovereignty, we now risk once again becoming the subject of one of our neighbors.\n\nThe threat of our enemy extends beyond our borders, however. Our neighbors in Sweden are still retaining a neutral stance towards the Soviet Union, but could perhaps be convinced to join us in defending our mutual legacy and secure their own strategic buffer."
 finland.2.a:0 "They should contribute to the stand we've taken."
 finland.2.b:0 "We have no need for the help of old oppressors."
 finland.3.t:0 "Finland Seeks Swedish Support"
 finland.3.d:0 "Our neighbor Finland has refused to give in to pressures from the Soviet Union, and the nations are now in a state of war. Although no formal alliance has been agreed upon between our countries, the Finnish government has requested that Sweden contribute to a joint defense of Åland, which remains largely Swedish-speaking and strategically important to both countries.\n\nWhile the government remains divided on what steps we should take to help Finland, the public support for their defense is notable. How far are we willing to go to protect our fellow Nordic counties from eastern aggression?"
 finland.3.a:0 "We must retain our neutrality."
 finland.3.b:0 "If public support is what they have, send volunteers and equipment."
 finland.3.c:0 "Finland's cause is ours! To war!"
 finland.4.t:0 "Sweden Rejects Request"
 finland.4.d:0 "The Swedish government has responded negatively to our request for aid in the war against the Soviet Union. Preferring to remain neutral to avoid international and internal repercussions, they are so far opposed to contributing to the war in any way."
 finland.4.a:0 "Let's hope they realize their mistake before it's too late."
 finland.5.t:0 "Sweden Sends Volunteers"
 finland.5.d:0 "The Swedish government has been unwilling to join us in the war against the Soviet Union, but public support among our neighbors is still high, and many volunteers from the other Nordic countries have offered to join our ranks to aid the war effort. Although less than we hoped, at least there is some popular awareness about the threat we are facing."
 finland.5.a:0 "It's the least one would expect."
 finland.6.t:0 "Sweden Joins Our War"
 finland.6.d:0 "Our request to the Swedish government for a joint defense of Åland has been met above expectations. Sweden has joined us in war against the Soviet Union, refusing to remain neutral in the face of such a blatant threat. Despite internal disagreements, they will now fight with us side by side to secure continued Finnish sovereignty."

A meeting has been set up in a secret location in Sweden, where we will be offered the opportunity to cede territory in return for continued [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty. \n\nThe Finnish forces are rapidly depleting, and previous attempts to open a line of communication has been unsuccesful. This may be our only hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict."

 finland.8.d:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has been a costly affair, but as we have been able to push back the [From.GetAdjective] army, they have presented us with a compelling offer. We are given control of strategically important areas, but need to withdraw our troops and cease further hostilities.\nThis will end our offensive on [From.GetNameDef] without full control over the region, but will in turn allow us to focus on extending our sphere of influece in other parts of the world."

 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."

 election.5.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t:0 "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."
 election.6.a:0 "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b:0 "Joining with the communists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.6.c:0 "A minority government, although weak, is preferable."

 election.7.d:1 "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a:0 "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b:0 "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t:0 "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d:0 "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."

 election.8.b:0 "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 election.11.t:0 "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."

 election.11.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t:0 "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

 election.14.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

 election.14.b:0 "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t:0 "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d:0 "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."

 election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

 political.1.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."

 political.2.t:0 "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a:0 "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b:0 "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t:0 "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."

 political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 political.16.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t:0 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a:0 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b:0 "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t:0 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"

 political.19.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot.

The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."

 political.25.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.
