 china.1.t:0 "The Marco Polo Bridge Incident"
 china.1.d:0 "Japanese soldiers recently launched an attack on the strategic Marco Polo Bridge just south of Beijing, but they were repelled by our brave soldiers. No doubt this is an orchestrated event aimed at placing blame on us and forcing us to surrender more territory - just like the Mukden Incident when the Japanese invaded Manchuria. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 china.1.a:0 "We have reached the breaking point!"
 china.1.b:0 "We can ill afford a war with Japan."
 china.2.t:0 "Germany Withdraws Advisors"
 china.2.d:0 "Germany has caved in to Japanese diplomatic pressure, and decided to withdraw their military advisors from our country! Von Falkenhausen promised at a farewell dinner that he would not reveal any of our battle plans to the Japanese, but the end of German support is sure to hurt our military."
 china.2.a:0 "We will have to make do without them."
 china.3.t:0 "Poor Sino - German Relations"
 china.3.d:0 "Our deteriorating relationship with Germany has resulted in them recalling all of their military advisors from our country."
 china.3.a:0 "Chinese officers will finish what they started!"
 china.4.t:0 "Military Advisors Detained"
 china.4.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Germany, all of their military advisors that were present in our country have been detained. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his cronies managed to elude our grasp, and have returned to Europe!"
 china.4.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 china.5.t:0 "Cornered No More"
 china.5.d:0 "The Red Army once survived in a state of what seemed like hopelessness, but since the Long March several years back, the tide has slowly turned. With significant territorial advances, our role as an underdog is a thing of the past. Having fought through this time of struggle, our desperation is now behind us. Mao Zedong has gone from guerrilla army leader to chairman."
 china.5.a:0 "Long live the People's Republic!"
 china.6.t:0 "Preparing Attack Against Communists"
 china.6.d:0 "After the long retreat of the Communist Party of China's Red Army, they have managed to regroup and establish themselves in Shaanxi. Their continued effort to turn the rural population against us and seek support from the Soviet Union suggest that they might grow more powerful if left to their own devices. However, many of the surrounding warlords, despite supporting our government, are unwilling or unable to make the necessary sacrifices for an effective attack.\n\nIt's currently unclear whether the Red Army is still recuperating or ready to face us in battle, but time is not on our side. To strengthen our political position, we need to strike against the communists."
 china.6.a:0 "Strongarm local warlords into the offensive."
 china.6.b:0 "Recruit local outlaws to fight for us."
 china.6.c:0 "Rely on local volunteers who oppose the communists."
 china.6.tt:0 "§YIf the PRC chooses to confront the attack:§!\n"
 china.6.tt_2:0 "§YIf the PRC chooses to retreat:§!\n"
 china.7.t:0 "Kuomintang Launch Offensive"
 china.7.d:0 "Although we have escaped certain defeat through the Long March, the nationalists are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our spies suggest they are mounting an offensive against us, which could weaken our political support if we try to retreat further.\n\nWe don't know how committed the Kuomintang are to pushing us back right now. Trying to confront them carries significant risks. If the local warlords have been rallied to support the attack, our chances may be slim. On the other hand, retreating now when we have finally stopped may not be an option."
 china.7.a:0 "Confront the attack with whatever means we can afford!"
 china.7.b:0 "Retreat into isolation."
 china.8.t:0 "Communists Retreat"
 china.8.d:0 "Discovering our planned offensive through their local spy network, the CPC have withdrawn their Red Army further into Shaanxi. Although this deprived us of the opportunity to further weaken their numbers, this has shown that the communists are not ready to confront us, despite what their propaganda says. To some extent, the effort has still worked to our benefit."
 china.8.a:0 "Cowards!"
 china.9.t:0 "Victory Against Communists"
 china.9.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Red Army has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the communists decided to confront our forces and lost. They have now been forced to withdraw further and many of the locals have grown skeptical of their ability to deliver on their promises of overthrowing our government."
 china.9.a:0 "And rightly so!"
 china.10.t:0 "Communists Repel Attack"
 china.10.d:0 "Having gained information about our plans to launch an offensive beforehand, the Red Army was prepared and confronted our attack. The troops we had managed to assemble in this area, where our power base is weak, were insufficient to defeat the communist forces. \nSadly, the attack has been turned against us and seen as a sign of the Red Army's recovery after their long retreat."
 china.10.a:0 "It won't help them in the long run."
 china.11.t:0 "Defeat Against the Kuomintang"
 china.11.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to repel the attack of locally assembled troops supporting the nationalist government, our preparations were insufficient to stop it. With significant losses, we have been forced into a new retreat, albeit shorter.\n\nConfronting the nationalists before we had fully recovered may have been a mistake. Our magnificent recovery in the Long March instilled hope in our supporters, but now, seeds of doubt have been sown."
 china.11.a:0 "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."
 china.12.t:0 "Victory Against the Kuomintang"
 china.12.d:0 "Challenging the Kuomintang offensive has worked in our favor. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Red Army were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly. \n\nThe nationalists have only proven that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
 china.12.a:0 "Political Power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 china.13.t:0 "Clash with Communist Guerrillas"
 china.13.d:0 "With both us and the Chinese Red Army barely having recovered from our previous offensive, our mutual troop presence close to the border has reignited the conflict. In addition to the local warlords and militias, we have considered moving in more troops from elsewhere.\n\nAlthough this may not give us opportunity to crush the communist menace once and for all, it would be an important ideological victory to show that they will not be allowed to expand further."
 china.13.a:0 "We must draw the line now!"
 china.13.b:0 "We can't afford another confrontation."
 china.14.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 china.14.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the communists will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with communist militias slowly turned out more and more in their favor, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their popular support keeps increasing, the communists could turn out to be a genuine threat."
 china.14.a:0 "Troubling."
 china.15.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 china.15.d:0 "After a number of smaller encounters in the outskirts of our controlled territory, the conflict with the Kuomintang appears to have turned to our advantage. Although maintaining constant pressure has been taxing on our troops and supplies, the effort has been worthwhile. \n\nNo decisive battles have been fought, we have won a slow victory this time, which has strengthened the faith in our cause and fanned the flames of the revolution once again."
 china.15.a:0 "This will not be soon forgotten!"
 china.16.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 china.16.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased Kuomintang presence has proven disastrous. The nationalists were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by the locals, and rumors of the failure of the revolution are already spreading to nearby villages."
 china.16.a:0 "The revolution is far from dead!"
 china.17.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 china.17.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of communism have been successful. The CPCs guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength, although not entirely without costs, has convinced many of the locals who previously gave their tacit support to [From.GetLeader] and his party have now begun to realize that China can never be united under such an ideology."
 china.17.a:0 "Let us hope they remember."
 china.18.t:0 "Clash with Nationalist Army"
 china.18.d:0 "While we have still barely recovered from their previous offensive, the nationalists appear to be increasing their troop presence in the areas close to our border. Clearly, they are trying to show that they once again have us contained and that the Great March only delayed their final strike against the CPC. We cannot let the people think this is true."
 china.18.a:0 "We cannot afford to spend our time recovering."
 china.100.t:0 "China Comes Under Further Attack"
 china.100.d:0 "Like a cat Japan advances and took Korea. They sought to humiliate us with their twenty-one demands, they occupy Manchuria and now they advance again. Well, no more, China will fight to her last to be free. In a speech to the people, [Root.GetLeader] appealed to all [Root.GetAdjective], that they stand together or face certain doom alone."

This is an opportunity to advance the interests of the CPC, we can show the people of China that it is us and not the decadent KMT who are the true future for China. Should we join the fight as well and ensure that there is a future for China?"

 spain.1.d:0 "A group of powerful generals in the Armed Forces have issued a pronunciamento, denouncing the current government of Spain! They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservative monarchists and the clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Spain's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Republican government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.1.a:0 "The Nationalists!"
 spain.1.b:0 "The Republicans!"
 spain.10.d:1 "After the peaceful election of General Francisco Franco as president of Spain, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumors that Franco would attempt to create a one-party dictatorship with himself as chief of state has been fueled by the sudden disappearances of several opposition leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Spain it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"

The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."

 spain.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement.

 finland.5.t:0 "Sweden Sends Volunteers"
 finland.5.d:0 "The Swedish government has been unwilling to join us in the war against the Soviet Union, but public support among our neighbors is still high, and many volunteers from the other Nordic countries have offered to join our ranks to aid the war effort.

While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them.

General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"

However, the possibility of FDR's death while still in office has remained, and today he passed away after suffering a stroke. Vice-President Harry S. Truman has now taken the oath of office, requesting the support and prayers of the people. The old cabinet remains, and Truman has vowed to continue many of the policies of his predecessor."

Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid.

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution.

 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

 political.19.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

 political.19.c:0 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 political.20.t:0 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 political.20.a:0 "Round them up."

 political.21.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup.

 political.22.t:0 "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.22.a:0 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 political.22.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 political.23.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 political.23.d:0 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."

 political.24.t:0 "Fascists Ridiculed"
 political.24.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.24.a:0 "What a bunch of clowns."
 political.25.t:0 "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.25.a:0 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 political.26.t:0 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.26.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

It's time to act.'\n\nA series of rousing speeches from [From.GetRulingParty] leaders, most prominently [From.GetLeader], has been calling the public to support an invasion of [Root.GetName].

The unprecedented destruction stands as a testament to the devastating power of this new weapon, which is feared not only for what it can do to its targets, but what implications it has for the one who deploys it and for humanity itself.\n\nThe world holds its breath waiting for what will come next.

More than two thirds of the city were instantly destroyed. Despite the city being built to withstand earthquakes, only a few sturdy structures survived the blast.\n\nWhile the power of the atomic bomb has been played up in the public mind, the human cost of the weapon has been played down. Neither side wants to contemplate the horror of the event, but its legacy will be one of lives lost in the blink of an eye and lasting fallout."

Weather conditions forced the planes to divert their mission, a combination of smoke, clouds and technical difficulties being deciding factors in an event that may well change history.\n\nThe effects of the bomb were contained somewhat by the city's location in a valley, but the damage is still severe. Some military installations were struck, but the catastrophic civilian losses overshadow them by far. It may take decades before we know the long-term effects of this weapon with certainty."

The city has suffered several attacks, in this war and the last, but all else pale in comparison to this. Not since the Thirty Years' War has Berlin seen comparable devastation - considering its growth, this was seen as an impossibility.\n\nThe Führerbunker appears to have survived the blast at least partially due to the bomb detonating away from its planned epicenter, and [From.Owner.GetLeader] is rumored to still be alive, if outraged. How [From.Owner.GetAdjective] leaders should be evacuated and if they can be protected from the fallout is another matter, however."

At [GetDateText], Big Ben chimed for the last time, having been melted by the blast. Early reports suggest Buckingham Palace has been completely leveled and the whereabouts of the royal family are currently unknown.\n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader] has nevertheless been confirmed to have survived and is preparing a rousing speech for the radio later today.

 nuke_dropped.6.d:0 "The city of Kyoto, a prominent [From.Owner.GetAdjective] industrial center, was struck today by a nuclear bomb. It is speculated that the city was chosen as a target because it has been regarded as an intellectual center.\n\nThe beauty and historical significance of the Kyoto led many to assume it would be spared from the bomb, but it appears the terror of raining destruction on such a place has rather been seen as a benefit, increasing the psychological impact of the attack. The city's location in the valley somewhat limited the blast, but the old Imperial Palace and many industrial buildings have been completely destroyed."

 nuke_dropped.7.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Tokyo"
 nuke_dropped.7.d:0 "Today, a nuclear strike was directed at the heart of the Japanese Empire. The capital of Tokyo, although expected to be the target of firebombing, was never assumed to be a prioritized target of this new weapon. Yet ultimately, perhaps due to the significance of the new capital and Imperial Palace which has now been destroyed, an even more all-consuming fire has fallen on the city.\n\nAlthough [From.Owner.GetLeader] is reported to have survived, the event has raised questions about how far Japan's enemies are willing to go. If the war does not end with this, what targets remain? What is left to threaten with?"

In an attack clearly directed at the political center and historical legacy of the US, the White House, the Capitol and a number of monuments and memorials were wiped off the face of the Earth. Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."

Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack. For a while, it looked like the city could aid the nation's recovery after the war was over. Those hopes have now been turned to dust, along with many people."

 nuke_dropped.10.d:0 "Today, a nuclear device was detonated over the city of Paris, causing widespread destruction and countless casualties. France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle Époque, is gone forever."

The explosion was directed at the heart of [From.Owner.GetAdjective] leadership, the Kremlin having been nearly completely destroyed by the blast.\n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader], having grown more aware and fearful of all possible and impossible threats recently, evacuated in time and survived. However, even the vastness of [From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy. Indeed, if this continues, the nation will soon consist only of two kinds of wastelands: Those which were there in the first place, and those created by its enemies."

 nuke_dropped.12.d:0 "Today, the city of Copenhagen was struck by a nuclear explosion. Having grown after escaping destruction in the Great War thanks to Denmark's neutrality, the capital has never experienced an attack close to this devastating since the Napoleonic Wars. The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."

 nuke_dropped.13.d:0 "The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."

Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Some party members are arguing that reinviting Trotsky and turning the purges on the Stalinists could minimize the damage of the civil war that will ensue.

Some of them believe that Stalin's rule has failed, others suspect they are simply waiting for the day when the NKVD will find or make an excuse to have them arrested.\n\nTogether, they have formed a faction powerful enough to challenge the current administration. Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counterrevolutionary traitors.

Rather than waiting to be imprisoned, executed and replaced, its leaders have decided to strike first and launch a coup with support from the similarly concerned military officials.\n\nHowever, despite its influential position, the NKVD has found it difficult to gain the trust of military leaders.

Furthermore, they promise that in the event of a war with Germany, we will be compensated for the loss by being granted new land in the west.\n\nWhile this may be a better offer than we expected, we can't know if this supposed future war will ever be pursued. Perhaps the Soviet Union is only looking for an easy land grab and forcing us into their sphere of influence. Nevertheless, it may be the best protection we can count on."
